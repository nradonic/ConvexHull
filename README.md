Abstract exercise to generate random 2D points, and then to calculate and draw the convex hull around the points, and the inner convex hull. The inner hull is 
facilitated by inverting the radius of the points about the mean radius, then to invert the points again and connect the mapped outer convex hull points as an 
inner polygon. 

Todo: the inner convex hull seems to fail as the inner/outer mapping is not correct, inthat the inner hull is not strictly convex.
